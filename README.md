## Updates 

This portfolio will be updated when I have more projects to showcase to my future employers. 

- Update: May 28, 2019: Modified my website with BootStrap. This will make the website cleaner looking, responsive and accessible. 
  - I took down the teal logo name, because I asked my sister to help me with a custome name logo (She's going to school for Graphic Design)
